            <p className={AboutCSS.paragraphStyle}>Welcome to Suite Sale! Built for the residents of 665 Roselawn Avenue by one of the residents of the building.</p>
            <p className={AboutCSS.paragraphStyle}>Inspired by local yard sales and having several items that I'd like to sell, I built this as a tool for us to post the things that we hope to sell easily. The best parts are that because this is local to the building we can avoid having to deal with packaging, shipping, distant deliveries, and transaction fees.</p>
            <p className={AboutCSS.paragraphStyle}>Which pretty much means that everyone gets to keep 100% of their profits and spend a lot less effort than we would normally need to in order to sell something.</p>
            <p className={AboutCSS.paragraphStyle}>I hope you like the site, I hope it can help you, and I hope to see you around the building!</p>
            <p className={AboutCSS.paragraphStyle}>Kindest regards,<br/>your friendly neighbourhood <span style={{ textDecoration: "line-through" }}>spider</span>man.</p>
