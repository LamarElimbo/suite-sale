      <p>For when you want to sell your stuff, but you donâ€™t want to deal with shipping or take off your pajamas.</p>
      <p>Inspired by local yard sales, I built this online marketplace for the residents of building I live in. People can post things that they want to sell and organize a time to meet in the lobby. The best part is that they get to keep 100% of the profits and avoid the packaging, costs, and duration that come with shipping.</p>
